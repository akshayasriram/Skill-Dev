While developing the Java standalone application for performing CRUD operations with a MySQL/Oracle database, I went through a step-by-step learning experience that strengthened my understanding of JDBC and database connectivity. Initially, I faced issues in setting up the database driver and establishing a proper connection between the Java application and the database. After configuring the JDBC URL, username, and password correctly, I was able to connect successfully. During the CRUD implementation, I encountered errors such as SQL syntax issues, data type mismatches, and exception handling problems. I debugged these by carefully checking the SQL queries and implementing try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully. For the UI, I used Java Swing/Console input to interact with the user, allowing them to insert, update, delete, and view records. I also faced challenges with refreshing data after operations and ensuring that database changes were committed correctly. By the end of the project, I had a fully functional application that could perform real-time CRUD operations reliably. This journey improved my confidence in Java programming, database design, and backend logic integration.
